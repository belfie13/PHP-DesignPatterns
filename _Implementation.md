# B13 PHP Design Patterns

mostly direct from the manual designed from the php language.

⚠️ see last heading 'Algorithms'


## Classes and Objects

- [ ] visibility
- [ ] abstract
- [ ] final
- [ ] magic methods
- [ ] interfaces
- [ ] cloning
- [ ] typehinting
- [ ] references

`$this` is a reference to the calling object within an object cont4xt
`$this` possibly references another object if static method context of a second object.
`new` create an instance of the class


### properties (constants / variables) and methods (functions)

define constants for
- value access keys
- identifiers (url...)


### extending other classes

`extends` inherit base functionality
- methods and properties with same name


#### overriding inheritance

- final prevents overrides
- parent:: to access overridden implementations


### implementing interfaces


### using traits


# Algorithms

* int = interface
* cls = class
* obj = object
* mth = method
* var = variable
* trt = trait
* ext = extends
* fin = final
* abs = abstract

- int {mth} -> cls
